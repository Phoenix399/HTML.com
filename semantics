            <h2>Interesting Facts About Dogs</h2>
            <ul>Dogs have an extraordinary sense of smell, up to 100,000 
                <li>times better than humans.</li>
                <li>There are over 340 different dog breeds worldwide.</li>
                <li>Dogs can understand up to 250 words and gestures.</li>
                <li>The Basenji dog is known as the "barkless dog" because it doesn't bark like other dogs.</li>
                <li>Dogs have been human companions for over 14,000 years.Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have

the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t

know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we

understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on

past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs

are the perfect example of this.</li>
