      <h2>Complete Book Summary (All Parts)</h2>
      <h3>Part I – The Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        Professor Otto Lidenbrock discovers a coded message written by an ancient Icelandic alchemist,
        Arne Saknussemm. His nephew Axel deciphers it, revealing instructions to reach the center of the Earth
        through the crater of an Icelandic volcano. Despite Axel’s fear, they travel to Iceland and hire
        a calm and reliable guide named Hans.
      </p>

      <h3>Part II – The Descent</h3>
      <p>
        The team enters the volcano Sneffels and descends through underground tunnels. They face hunger,
        heat, and the risk of getting lost. Axel becomes separated from the others but survives after
        discovering an underground water source. They reunite and continue deeper, proving human endurance
        against nature.
      </p>

      <h3>Part III – The Underground World</h3>
      <p>
        The explorers reach a vast underground sea lit by electrical phenomena. Axel witnesses prehistoric
        plants, fossils, and living ancient sea creatures battling each other. They sail across the sea
        on a raft and discover evidence of early humans, showing that life has existed underground for ages.
      </p>

      <h3>Part IV – Escape and Return</h3>
      <p>
        Their journey is cut short by volcanic activity. Swept upward by an eruption, they are expelled
        from the Earth through a volcano in Italy. Though they never reach the literal center of the Earth,
        the expedition becomes famous, and Professor Lidenbrock is celebrated for his discovery.
