    Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving space technology. It has led to remarkable achievements, such as landing humans on the Moon, sending robotic probes to distant planets, and deploying telescopes that peer into the farthest reaches of the universe.<br><br>
    The journey began with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, marking the start of the space age. Since then, both crewed and uncrewed missions have expanded our understanding of the cosmos. The Apollo missions brought back lunar samples, while Mars rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance have been searching for signs of past life and studying the planet’s geology.<br><br>
    Space exploration has also contributed to technological advancements on Earth, including satellite communications, GPS, and weather forecasting. International cooperation, such as the International Space Station (ISS), has fostered peaceful collaboration and scientific research in microgravity.<br><br>
    Looking ahead, future missions aim to return humans to the Moon, send astronauts to Mars, and explore the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The search for exoplanets and extraterrestrial life continues to inspire scientists and the public alike, driving innovation and expanding humanity’s horizons.
